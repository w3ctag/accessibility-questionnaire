1. Does the design add a new type of visible user interface or content?
  
  For example:
	- a new type of UI element
	- a new mechanism for drawing custom interfaces
	- a requirement for some user agent UI
   
1. Can an API be used to change the visual appearance of web content?
  
  For example:
   - A new type of CSS layout directive


1. Does the design introduce a way to interpret or manipulate user interaction?
  
  For example:
   - Anything which impacts focus
   - Any new type of user interaction event, user interaction mode, or interaction device

1. Is there any audible user interface?
  
  For example:
	- a notification sound
	- a speech-based interface
	- an audio stream (alone or with other timed media).

1. Is any new interface introduced by the specification only available for a given amount of time?
 For example:
	- a notification which disappears (e.g. toast)

1. If the spec is API-only, is any user-presented data passed through the protocol?

  For example:
	- a transport mechanism for media, such as images, video, or audio which may benefit from including an alternative representation as part of the payload

1. Does the specification change or introduce a new form of user input at an API level?

  For example:
	- a new type of input event
	- a change to an existing mechanism for handling user input (e.g. focus)

1. Is the specification constrained to a specific user interface device/modality?
  For example:
	- a gamepad
	- a touch screen (imagine using a touch centric UI blindfolded)
  
Question: Does the specification expose the existence of AT in any way or form? (this probably belongs in the S&P, but I can't find any specific mentions of accessibility there)
